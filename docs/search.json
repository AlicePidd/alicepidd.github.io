    "text": "Ahoy, and thanks for visiting!\nI am a PhD student, chronic problem-solver, question-asker, and out-of-doors enthusiast. I am most interested in answering questions related to global marine sustainability and the persistence of species, particularly surrounding the efficacy of current ocean management in the face of climate threats. PhD’s grant many wonderful opportunities that lead to realisations, the most notable among mine being a love for data visualisation, teaching, and finding solutions that are robust to the passage of time.\nWith an expected graduation date of September 2025, I am searching for post-doc opportunities around the world within the field of quantitative marine ecology. I am particularly interested in projects with a focus on using climate projections and metrics to understand the possible responses of marine biodiversity to mid- and long-term climate threats, and to use this to inform the management of resources."

    "text": "PhD chapters (University of the Sunshine Coast, QLD, Australia)\n\n\nFuture ocean climate and implications for Australia’s marine protected areas (in press)\n\n\n Climate change is a pervasive global threat to people and nature. In the oceans, there is a suite of climate impacts, including chronic stressors such as warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and acute stressors such as marine heatwaves. The primary approach for conserving marine biodiversity is the use of protected areas, which can manage local stressors such as fishing, shipping and mining, but offer little protection from climate change if they are not designed around areas of least change. Here we use climate projections from a suite of CMIP6 Earth System Models to assess the exposure to climate change of waters within the Australian EEZ, and implications for the protected area network. We find that marine ecosystems will experience conditions outside their historical range for all scenarios that exceed 2°C warming this century, resulting in a disappearance of climate refugia – areas of slowest change – by 2040. The loss of climate refugia is likely to lead to poor biodiversity outcomes, including movement of biodiversity outside protected area boundaries. However, we find some capacity for the re-emergence of refugia in the latter half of the century under stronger mitigation scenarios. Moreover, we find that the placement of Australian marine protected areas (MPAs) in terms of climate change is no better than random. The MPA network has a similar exposure to warming, acidification, deoxygenation and marine heatwaves than areas outside, implying limited consideration of climate change in protected area design. Our findings on the changes in chronic stressors, extreme events and climate refugia could be used to expand or redesign the current network to increase climate resilience to climate change."
