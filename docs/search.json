My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "Quarto ‘quick and dirty’ or {Golem} for longevity and complexity?\nAs expected in an open-source programming language, the app-making landscape in R seems to be in constant flux. Something newish that I’ve been finding useful lately is using Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ feature.\nQuarto is very similar to Rmarkdown, but has a few additional features. One of them is the ability to embed R {shiny} apps. So you end up writing your app like you would a markdown doc - the context, ui, and server are all code chunks, and the text around those code chunks set’s up the UI. For example, normally in markdown we use # to delineate and navigate headers; in Quarto Shiny Dashboards, # are used to delineate pages, tab panels, etc.\nI’ve found it’s great for proto-typing simple apps - you can get something up and running very quickly in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’. However, I think it could get unwieldy when you start building complex apps with modules etc. In that case, developing your {shiny} app as an R package with {golem} might be a better option. {golem} provides a great framework for engineering production grade shiny apps that are complex and can be easily maintained in the long-term.\nI ended up turning the prototype app I built in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ into an R package with {golem}. It took much longer than I expected, but much of that time was learning about R package development (which I had never done before) and {golem}.\nIn the end I think it was worth the extra time and effort streamline as an R package. But if you want to compare for yourself, find the protoype Quarto dashboard shiny here and the {golem} R package version here.\nCurious to hear others’ experiences though - please get in touch."
